# Image Classifier for Cats and Dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Description:
Developed a deep learning-based image classification system to distinguish between cats and dogs with high accuracy. Leveraged **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification, utilizing **TensorFlow** as the deep learning framework. The project involved:

- Preprocessing a dataset of labeled images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.
- Designing and training a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Implementing techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy and loss on training and validation datasets.
- Deploying the classifier and demonstrating real-time predictions on new images.
